# python-api-challenge - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?


## Part I - WeatherPy

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, take the time to explain what the linear regression is modeling. For example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.

Your final notebook must:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.
* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. 
  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.
* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.


## Final Conclusion:
After a full review of the data and the various plots, I have concluded that it is not only hotter as you move towards the equator, it is also more humid. Cloudiness and windspeeds south of the equator are less easy to predict but it is clear that as you reach either the North or South Pole, you will find extreme cold, wind, and lack of clouds. Ultimately, after completing the VacationPy, I decided I would highly recommend taking sunblock to the equator, and not only warm gloves, but a nice wind breaker to the poles.
